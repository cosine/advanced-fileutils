AdvFileUtils is a collection of advanced file utilities for Ruby scripts.

It is presently incomplete.  Only append and truncate are partially
implemented so far -- those functions work with :noop and :verbose but
the :force and :preserve options do nothing.

The particular collection of available functions is also in flux.  Some
may even be spun out into other libraries.
